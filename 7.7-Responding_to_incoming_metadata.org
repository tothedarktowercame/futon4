*** How to deal with metadata

This section gives support for article owners dealing with incoming
metadata coming from editing events.  An important example: scholia
may see suggested changes to their \inp{about} data when the
article(s) that they are about change).  Authors might want to
incorporate such incoming changes into their document, or obliterate
them, or revise them.  Perhaps a scholium author will want their
comments to apply to the version of the article it commented on, but
not to the revised version.  Or perhaps a scholium author would like
to drop their content all together (to the extent that this is
possible).  We'll do what we can to accomodate these various actions
in this section.
