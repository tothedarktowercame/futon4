Interactive functions that call `scholium' should always provide
\inp{bookkeeping} information.

The following definition can be extended to add any sort of initial
bookkeeping information we might like to maintain.  The
\inp{bookkeeping} field will be revised when the article is edited
(see Section [[id:editing]]).
