** Some extremely simple example to show people what's going on    :noexport:

*** Simplest example

It would be handy to create a very simple example of a buffer
together with scholia.


*** Next-simplest example

After that, it would be handy to make an example of a properly
scholia-based document (showing some richer graph structure).


*** Various other simple examples?

And while we're at it, maybe later a simple example of transclusion or
identification or whatever.
