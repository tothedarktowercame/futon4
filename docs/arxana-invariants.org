* Window/Frame invariants
- No new frames are created by default during Arxana browsing actions.
- A new focal buffer replaces the previous focal buffer in the same frame.
- The previous focal buffer is considered to be "left" of the new focal buffer (off-screen in the navigation stack).
- Ancillary buffers (scholia, lists, support panes) do not become focal automatically.
