# Doc ticket: XTDB browsing system

## Code region
`dev/arxana-xtdb-browse.el` - entire file

## What needs documenting
- What XTDB is (the durable time-traveling database)
- The tabulated list view of recent relations
- The `/tail` endpoint and what it returns
- How to inspect entity payloads
- Jumping to relation buffers from XTDB rows
- The limit configuration

## Context
XTDB browsing lets users see the raw database activity. It's useful for debugging and auditing.

## Suggested depth
Light: focus on how to use the browser, not XTDB internals.

## Expected word count
200-250 words
