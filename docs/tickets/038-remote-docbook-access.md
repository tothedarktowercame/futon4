# Doc ticket: Remote docbook access

## Code region
`dev/arxana-docbook-remote.el`

## What needs documenting
- When remote access is used vs. filesystem
- The availability check (`arxana-docbook--remote-available-p`)
- How remote headings are fetched
- Integration with the local filesystem fallback
- Configuration for remote access

## Context
Docbook entries can come from remote sources as well as local files. This explains that dual-source model.

## Suggested depth
Light: explain when remote is used and how to configure it.

## Expected word count
150-200 words
