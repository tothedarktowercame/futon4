- What metadata scholia are and why they're paired 1-1
- Events as hyperedges with N endpoints

- The relationship between these concepts
- Examples of each in practice

## Context
This conceptual foundation needs a clear, accessible explanation before diving into implementation details.

## Suggested depth
