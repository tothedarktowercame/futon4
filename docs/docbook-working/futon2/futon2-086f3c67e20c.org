* Overview
Policy selection lives in `ants.aif.policy/choose-action`. It scores abstract
actions using expected free energy, then samples a softmax distribution
driven by the current precision (`tau`).

* Inputs
The policy step consumes the current observation vector (food, pheromone,
trace signals, home proximity, hunger) plus recent action history and tuning
parameters. These inputs bias exploration versus exploitation.

* Outputs
The function returns the chosen action along with diagnostics used by the HUD
and trace tooling to explain why the action was selected.
