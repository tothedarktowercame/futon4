* Overview
Observation lives in `ants.aif.observe/g-observe`. It gathers local evidence
from the grid (food, pheromone, proximity, trace signals) and normalizes the
channels into a stable evidence vector.

* ABI and normalization
The sense vector ordering is a stable ABI consumed by the rest of the AIF
stack. Inputs are normalized to `[0,1]` using max caps and epsilon thresholds
so agents remain comparable across grid sizes.
