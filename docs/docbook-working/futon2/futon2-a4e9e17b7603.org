* Overview
Predictive coding lives in `ants.aif.perceive/perceive`. It runs a short
sequence of micro-steps that update the belief state (`mu`, `prec`) to reduce
prediction error against the current observation.

* Micro-step trace
Each micro-step records `:tau`, `:h`, and `:error` snapshots. The full trace
is returned alongside free energy summaries and is used by the trace
analyzer tools and golden tests.

* Outputs
The perceive step returns updated beliefs, accumulated errors, a free-energy
estimate, and the trace vector for downstream inspection.
