* Overview
The grid world lives in `ants.war`. It encodes the Rich Hickey ruleset plus
Futon2 extensions: food placement, pheromone evaporation, movement, combat,
and carrying logic.

* World state
The world tracks hive positions, food caps, pheromone trails, and fallen ants
so the HUD and visualizer can render consistent snapshots. Physics updates
are deterministic given the same initial config and random seed.
