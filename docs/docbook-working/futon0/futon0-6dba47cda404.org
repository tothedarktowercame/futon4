* Overview
The negative space notifier is a small reminder loop that fires when nothing
has happened yet (for example, leaving for Tai Chi or shutting down for the
night). It is intentionally simple and external to Emacs so it can nudge you
even when the stack UI is closed.

* Delivery path
User systemd timers call `scripts/negative_space_notify.py`, which emits
desktop notifications via `notify-send` and falls back to stdout if the
notifier is unavailable. The timers live in `systemd/` and are installed as
`negative-*` units.

* Schedules
The shipped timers cover Tai Chi (18:30 / 18:50 on Wed/Thu) and nightly
curfew reminders (20:30 / 20:50). Disable or adjust the timers to tune the
cadence without touching code.
