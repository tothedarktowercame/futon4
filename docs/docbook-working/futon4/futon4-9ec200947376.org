* Overview
Entity history queries expose XTDB time-travel for a specific entity. The
command `arxana-store-entity-history` hits `/entities/history/:id` and returns
prior versions of the entity record.

* Limit and usage
The helper accepts a limit argument to control how many historical versions are
returned. Use it when you want a concise audit trail or a deeper provenance
review.

* Use cases
- Debugging unexpected changes to entity metadata.
- Auditing who or what updated a record.
- Reconstructing provenance for derived entities.
