* Overview
Relation browsing is the entry point for exploring the graph neighborhood of an
article. The current Emacs wrapper focuses on the ego view, which shows the
inbound and outbound edges for a named entity. Co-occur and tail views are
available via the store helpers and XTDB browser but are not yet wrapped with
dedicated commands in `arxana-relations.el`.

* Step-by-step (ego view)
1. Run `M-x arxana-relations-show-ego` and enter the article name.
2. The buffer lists outgoing and incoming relations in separate sections.
3. The header line shows the Futon id (or “unknown” if it could not resolve).
4. Press `g` to refresh the view with the same limit and name.
5. Press `y` to copy the Futon id to the kill ring.

* Interpreting the display
Outgoing lines show “<neighbor> via <relation-type>” for edges where the ego is
source. Incoming lines use the same format but reflect edges where the ego is
the target. This split makes it clear which edges you authored versus which ones
reference you.

* Co-occur and tail views
The store helper `arxana-store-cooccur` fetches the co‑occurrence list for a
name, and `arxana-store-tail` fetches recent relations. For a tabulated list of
recent activity, use `M-x arxana-xtdb-browse`. A future `arxana-relations-show-`
wrapper can present these alongside ego once the UI is expanded.

* Keybindings
The relations buffer uses `arxana-relations-buffer-mode` with these defaults:

- `g` refreshes the current view.
- `y` copies the Futon id.
- `p` opens the provenance view (when configured).
