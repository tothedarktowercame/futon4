* Overview
The media library manages audio tracks, projects, publications, and podcasts
inside Arxana. It integrates filesystem catalogs with Futon metadata so you can
browse recordings, stage EPs, edit lyrics, and control playback from the browser
UI.

* Directory structure
The library expects a Zoom‑style catalog plus working directories:

- `arxana-media-zoom-root` and `arxana-media-index-path` point to recording
  catalogs.
- `arxana-media-publications-root` stores published EPs.
- `arxana-media-ep-staging-root` is a staging area before publication.
- `arxana-media-misc-root` holds misc audio folders.
- `arxana-media-podcast-roots` enumerate podcast output trees.

* Track metadata and projects
Tracks are normalized into entries with title, status, sha256, and derived
project labels. Status markers and publication URLs are stored in metadata
files (e.g., `publication.json`) and are surfaced in the browser list.

* Publications and EP staging
The EP workflow splits browsing into “Publications” and “EP staging.” Selecting
an EP shows its tracks; you can retitle, stage, and publish via browser commands.
This lets you move from raw recordings to curated releases without leaving the
UI.

* Playback and controls
Playback routes through an external player defined by
`arxana-media-player-program`. The browser maps keys for play/stop, seek, pause,
and autoplay next. Playback queues are built from the current view, so you can
play through a project or folder sequentially.

* Marks and batch operations
The browser supports marking tracks for batch actions: publish, stage to EP,
set status, or delete. Marks are scoped to the current view, and the header line
reflects the active filter so you can keep track of what the batch applies to.
