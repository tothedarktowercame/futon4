* Overview
Profiles let you separate workspaces or plexuses on the same Futon server.
Arxana sends the active profile via the `X-Profile` HTTP header so the server
can route reads and writes to the appropriate working set.

* Configuration
Set `arxana-store-default-profile` to the profile name you want to use. The
header is attached by `arxana-store--default-headers` for every request once
the value is set.

* Use cases
- Separate personal and team workspaces.
- Maintain parallel projects on a shared Futon instance.
- Switch between experimental and production data sets.

* Switching profiles
Update `arxana-store-default-profile` and rerun the operation. The header is
included in subsequent requests; no restart is required.
