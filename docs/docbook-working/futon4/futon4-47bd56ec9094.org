* Overview
The lab export scripts convert session logs into structured artifacts under
`lab/`. They generate raw JSON, Org stubs, and trace files so lab sessions can
be browsed and summarized alongside other Arxana materials.

* Scripts and roles
- `dev/lab-export.clj` reads a Codex session JSONL and writes `lab/raw`,
  `lab/stubs`, and `lab/trace` entries.
- `dev/lab-export-claude.clj` does the same for Claude session JSONL, including
  tool-use extraction when available.
- `dev/lab-summarize.clj` uses an LLM to generate a structured Org stub from a
  raw session JSON entry.
- `dev/lab-summary.clj` generates a concise session summary in org/json/text
  formats from `lab/raw`.

* Running the scripts
All scripts accept CLI flags (see the usage output at the top of each file).
Typical usage includes `--session-file` for exports and `--raw` for summaries.
Most scripts support `--dry-run` to preview outputs without writing.

* Integration points
Exports are stored under `lab/raw`, `lab/stubs`, `lab/trace`, and `lab/summaries`.
These outputs feed the lab notebook browser and can be promoted into docbook
entries as part of the documentation pipeline.
