* Overview
Marks let you stage batch operations in the Arxana Browser. Each view maintains
a hash table of marked items keyed by a stable identifier (for example a track
sha or doc id), so marks survive refreshes and pagination.

* Mark workflow
- Press `m` to toggle a mark on the current row.
- Press `U` to clear all marks in the current view.
- Use batch commands (publish, delete, remove) to act on the marked set.

* Context-aware filtering
`arxana-browser-marks-items-in-context` filters the current item list against
the mark table, so only items in the active view are considered. This prevents
marks from bleeding across unrelated views.

* Batch operations
Batch operations call the helper with a view-specific key function (e.g., track
sha or doc id). This keeps the mark semantics consistent while allowing each
view to define its own notion of identity.
