* Overview
Relation types describe how two entities are connected. Simple relations use a
single `type` field, while hyperedges use `:hx/type` plus endpoint roles. The
naming conventions below are the current defaults.

* Simple relations
- `arxana/scholium` is used for scholia relations between a source and target
  article. These appear in `/ego` and `/cooccur` like any other edge.

* Hyperedge types
Hyperedges carry `:hx/type` values such as inclusion or transclusion. These are
used when the relation needs more than two endpoints or role annotations (for
example, a passage span).

* Derivation markers
Derivation previews classify ranges as `:inclusion`, `:transclusion`, or
`:identification` based on scholia tags in the rendered buffer. These markers
control highlighting and labeling in the UI.

* Query visibility
Simple relations appear directly in relation queries. Hyperedges appear as event
entities and are surfaced through their endpoint roles and `:hx/type` values.

* Custom relation types
You can introduce new relation labels or hyperedge types by passing a custom
`type` or `:hx/type` when creating relations. Keep naming consistent and document
new types in the docbook model descriptors.
