* Prerequisites
Ensure both the source and target articles are registered (locally and in
Futon, if sync is enabled). If you can open the articles and they resolve ids
via `futon4--article-id-for`, you are ready to post scholia.

* Step-by-step
1. Run `M-x arxana-scholium-compose` to open a scholium buffer.
2. Enter the scholium text.
3. Publish with `C-c C-c` (the legacy scholium publishing command).
4. The system resolves source/target ids and posts a relation to `/relation`.
5. Verify the scholium via an ego query or by inspecting `/tail`.

* Compose vs upsert
`arxana-scholium-compose` is the interactive authoring flow; it opens a buffer
and uses the classic scholium tools. `arxana-store-upsert-scholium` is the
programmatic API for directly posting a scholium relation when you already have
source and target names.

* Region scholia
To annotate a specific passage, use `M-x arxana-scholium-compose-from-region`.
This invokes the legacy “about part of current article” flow and attaches the
scholium to the selected range.

* Verifying results
Scholia show up in `/ego` for both source and target articles. Use
`arxana-relations-show-ego` or the XTDB browser to confirm the relation exists.
