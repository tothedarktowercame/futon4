* Overview
Docbook entries can come from remote storage or the local filesystem. Remote
access uses the Futon API when sync is enabled; the filesystem is the fallback
when remote storage is unavailable.

* When remote is used
Remote access is active when `arxana-docbook-remote-enabled` is non-nil, sync is
enabled, and `futon4-base-url` is available. The probe helper
`arxana-docbook--remote-available-p` checks the remote toc endpoint and records
whether the remote store is ok, empty, or unreachable.

* Fallback behavior
If the remote probe fails, the browser falls back to filesystem entries under
`docs/docbook-working/<book>/`. The data source label in the header line shows
whether the view is backed by storage, filesystem, or ephemeral state.

* Configuration
Set `futon4-base-url` and enable sync to turn on remote docbook access. If you
want to force local-only browsing, disable `arxana-docbook-remote-enabled`.
