* Overview
`dev/boundary-generate.clj` writes a repo-local `boundary.edn` snapshot with
counts for lab artifacts and media ingestion state. It is a lightweight health
check for missing evidence and outstanding work.

* Inputs and outputs
Inputs include the repo root and an optional media index path. The output is a
single `boundary.edn` file containing counts for lab/raw, lab/stubs, lab
 doc-drafts, and media entries that are still unpersisted.

* When to run
Run the script when you need an at-a-glance inventory of lab and media coverage,
or when preparing a status report that needs concrete counts.
