* Overview
Org export writes the current article table to a portable directory of `.org`
files plus a manifest. This is the recommended way to share or archive Arxana
content outside of Futon/XTDB.

* Step-by-step
1. Run `M-x arxana-export-org-directory`.
2. Choose a destination directory.
3. If sync is enabled, select a snapshot scope and optional label.
4. The exporter writes one `.org` file per article and a `MANIFEST.org` summary.

* Export structure
The destination directory contains:

- One `.org` file per article, named from a sanitized article title.
- `MANIFEST.org`, which records the snapshot info and an index of articles.

Each article file starts with a `#+TITLE` header followed by the body text.

* Manifest contents
`MANIFEST.org` includes:

- Snapshot metadata (ID and scope, when available).
- A table listing article name, file, Futon id, labels, and links.
- A label index section for quick browsing of tags and relationships.

* Snapshots and verification
When Futon sync is enabled, the exporter can request a snapshot via
`arxana-store-save-snapshot` before writing files. This lets you tie the export
back to a specific XTDB snapshot id for reproducibility.
