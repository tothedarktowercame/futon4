* Overview
Snapshots can capture either the full history or just the current state.
Arxana exposes two scopes: `all` and `latest`.

* Scope meanings
- `all` captures the complete XTDB history for the selected data set.
- `latest` captures only the current state, omitting historical versions.

* Choosing a scope
Use `all` when you need provenance, time travel, or full auditability. Use
`latest` when you want a lighter snapshot for sharing or quick restores.

* Prompt behavior
When saving a snapshot, `arxana-store--snapshot-scope-prompt` asks for the scope
and validates it against the allowed list. Invalid values are rejected with a
clear error.
