* Overview
A scholium is Arxana’s annotation unit: a commentary or note that targets
another article (or a passage within it). The scholium workflow bridges the
legacy authoring UI and the Futon relation model so annotations become searchable
edges in the graph.

* Authoring entry points
The historical flow uses `new-scholium-mode` and related helpers. The modern
wrapper is `arxana-scholium-compose`, which opens a scholium buffer and guides
you to publish with `C-c C-c`. `arxana-scholium-compose-from-region` creates a
scholium tied to a region of the current article, using the classic “about
part of current article” helper under the hood.

* Resolving source and target
When a scholium is published, its source and target articles are resolved to
Futon ids. `arxana-store-upsert-scholium` looks up ids via
`futon4--article-id-for`, then posts a relation between the two ids. If either
id is missing, it records an error rather than failing silently.

* Storage and relation type
Scholia are stored as relations with the label “arxana/scholium”. That means
scholia show up alongside other edges in `/ego` and `/cooccur` queries, making
annotations discoverable in the same graph navigation tools.

* Where they appear
Once posted, scholia appear in the ego view for both the source and target
articles. This makes commentary visible from either side: you can inspect what
notes an article has authored as well as which notes reference it.
