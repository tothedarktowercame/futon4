* Overview
The Arxana logical model starts with a single primitive: the *nema*. A nema is a
universal node record with a stable id, labels, optional endpoints, and a
payload. Everything else—articles, events, metadata, and plexuses—are nemas with
conventions layered on top. This keeps the graph open‑schema while still
allowing specialized behaviors where needed.

* Articles and metadata scholia
An article is a nema labeled `:label/article` whose payload contains the core
text and metadata. Each article has a paired metadata scholium: a separate nema
that caches backlinks, labels, indexes, and other derived fields. The one‑to‑one
pairing keeps read performance fast without mixing derived state into the
article itself.

* Events as hyperedges
Events are nemas that represent hyperedges. They carry an `:hx/type` and an
endpoint list rather than a single src/dst pair. This enables N‑ary relations:
provenance chains, inclusions, and annotations can connect multiple entities in
one edge while still tagging each endpoint with a role. In practice, a single
transclusion event might link a source article, a passage range, and a target
article as three distinct endpoints.

* Plexuses
A plexus is a nema that names a working set or profile. It is not a “folder” so
much as a graph‑level lens: a plexus can store configuration, membership, and
view preferences, allowing multiple overlapping workspaces to coexist over the
same underlying hypergraph.

* Relationship between concepts
Think of the model as a shared substrate:

- Nema is the base node type.
- Article is a labeled nema with text payload.
- Metadata scholium is a 1–1 paired nema that indexes the article.
- Event is a hyperedge nema with `:hx/type` and endpoint roles.
- Plexus is a nema that groups and configures a working set.

Because all of these are nemas, they can participate in the same graph queries.
Articles can reference plexuses; events can annotate metadata scholia; plexuses
can themselves be related by events. The model stays uniform even as the
semantics specialize.

* Examples
- Article: `:label/article` with `:article/text` and basic metadata fields.
- Metadata scholium: a paired nema with backlink lists and label caches.
- Event: an inclusion hyperedge connecting a source article and a target
  article, optionally with a passage endpoint.
- Plexus: a nema with `:plexus/members` and view settings for a project.
