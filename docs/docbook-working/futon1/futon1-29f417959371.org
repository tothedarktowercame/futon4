* Overview
`apps/demo` is a minimal REPL-like shell around the client session runner.
It is the fastest way to smoke-test the stack locally without standing up
the HTTP API server.

* Usage
From the repo root run `clojure -M:run-m` or `bb demo`. The CLI accepts free
text turns plus the same slash/bang commands as the API, and it prints EDN
summaries plus the focus header to stdout.

* Role
The demo wrapper is intentionally thin: it delegates to `apps/client` for
ingest, graph updates, and focus header logic, so the CLI stays deterministic
with the API and tests.
