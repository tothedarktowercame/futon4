* Overview
`apps/open-world-ingest` is a standalone CLI that streams arbitrary text into
Futon1 using the CoreNLP-backed pipeline. It is designed for large batch
imports where the input is not already structured.

* Pipeline behavior
The ingest pipeline extracts entities, mentions, and relations, writes them
into XTDB, and registers relation types when OpenIE can derive a usable
predicate. When the predicate cannot be resolved it falls back to the
generic `:links-to` edge.

* Type registry integration
Unrecognized entity types are queued in the model registry so archivists can
decide whether to formalize them. This keeps open-world ingestion flexible
without breaking the invariants enforced by the registry.
