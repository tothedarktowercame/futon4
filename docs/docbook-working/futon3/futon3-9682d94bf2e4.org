* Overview
`f2.transport` implements the MUSN transport layer. WebSocket clients connect
via `/musn/ws` while HTTP clients stream NDJSON to `/musn/ingest`.

* Routing and lifecycle
The transport assigns `run-id` and per-frame acknowledgements, maintains
per-client history, and enforces back-pressure. It routes hello/event/eval
frames into the appropriate handlers and emits structured `ack` or `err`
replies.
