#+TITLE: Arxana Reanimation Plan
#+AUTHOR: Futon4 / Arxana team
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:t

* Purpose

This living specification tracks the work required to bring the classic
Arxana Emacs client back into a fully functional state while targeting the
Futon1 EAV backend.  Each milestone links source material (Org chapters,
Elisp modules, docs) to concrete validation steps so we can prove round-trip
behavior at every stage.

* Workflow loop

1. Load the dev harness (`M-x arxana-build` or `dev/run-tests.sh`).
2. Run the ERT smoke suite to verify the harness still loads.
3. Exercise the feature under development inside Emacs and via Futon curl
   checks, capturing the commands we expect contributors to run.
4. Update this file and the corresponding XTDB doc entry with new tasks,
   status, and references.

* Milestone tracker

** M0 — Harness & Spec [3/3]
- [X] Record the reanimation scope and workflow in this document.
- [X] Provide a repeatable bootstrap harness (interactive + batch).
- [X] Seed a minimal ERT suite that gatekeeps the harness.

** M1 — Storage Bridge Hardening [5/5]
- [X] Audit Futon sync funcs (`futon4-*`) and document supported ops (`docs/storage-bridge.org`).
- [X] Wrap backend calls with user-facing commands (`arxana-store-*`).
- [X] Capture curl verification steps per endpoint (see storage bridge doc + README).
- [X] Add ERT/Elisp fakes for entity + relation flow (`test/arxana-store-test.el`).
- [X] Ensure Emacs gracefully handles Futon downtime (error plists + log messages).

** M2 — Article Lifecycle [5/5]
- [X] Restore buffer/file → article flows with canonical ids (bootstrap + path cache).
- [X] Rebuild metadata scholium syncing for labels/backlinks (hooks feed Futon props).
- [X] Confirm deletes/updates propagate to Futon history (`status` updates + history docs).
- [X] Provide regression fixtures for article round trips (ERT store/article tests).
- [X] Document workflows in `README.md` (editing, syncing, verifying).

** M3 — Scholia & Relations [4/4]
- [X] Reinstate scholium authoring minor mode + Futon relation mirroring.
- [X] Surface `/ego`, `/cooccur`, `/tail` data inside Emacs buffers.
- [X] Add automated checks for scholium adjacency.
- [X] Expand docs with relation troubleshooting steps.

** M4 — Browsing & Rendering [5/5]
- [X] Re-enable Part VI browsing modes (local, catalog, temporal, linear).
- [X] Tie rendering buffers to Futon ids for refresh + provenance.
- [X] Build UI affordances for inclusion/derivation previews.
- [X] Validate expanded/collapsed views with backend data.
- [X] Add narrative examples demonstrating the flows.

** M5 — Workflow plumbing [3/4]
- [X] Map inclusion/derivation/provenance events to multi-end Futon edges.
- [X] Connect save/restore to XTDB snapshots instead of legacy stores.
- [X] Create import/export shims for modern doc formats.
- [ ] Produce migration notes for historical datasets.

** M5A — Inclusion/Transclusion UX [3/3]
- [X] Visually differentiate included vs. transcluded regions in the main article buffer.
- [X] Provide toggle commands to highlight each derivative type independently.
- [X] Document the visual affordances and add a regression test covering both styles.

** M6 — QA & Release Prep [2/4]
- [X] Grow the ERT suite (unit, integration, CLI smoke).
- [X] Document test instructions + CI hooks.
- [ ] Provide contributor guide (coding style, doc sync, testing).
- [ ] Tag a “revived” release with reproducible steps.

** Doc sync tracker [2/6]
- [X] Storage + snapshots (`arxana-store`, `arxana-saving`).
- [X] Browsing & relations (`arxana-browse`, `arxana-relations`, `arxana-xtdb-browse`).
- [ ] Import/export helpers (`arxana-import`, `arxana-export`).
- [ ] Pattern workflows (`arxana-patterns` + ingest shims).
- [ ] Article/scholium/inclusion stack (`arxana-article`, `arxana-scholium`, `arxana-inclusion`).
- [ ] QA/compat/test support modules.

   Each check means the module has a matching XTDB doc entry and any optional
   filesystem snapshot is aligned with the current `dev/` behavior. If a snapshot
   exists, record the doc id and snapshot location in `dev/org-sync-tracker.org`.

* Artifacts

- Harness + bootstrap: `dev/bootstrap.el`
- Tests: `test/`
- Docs: this plan and future how-tos.

Update this plan whenever a milestone progresses; keep the checklist honest.
