* Overview
Arxana includes lightweight diagnostics for store failures and for inspecting
folding behavior in flexiarg buffers. These tools are meant for quick triage
when sync or rendering behaves unexpectedly.

* Store diagnostics
Use `M-x arxana-store-ping` to probe the Futon API. It runs a `/tail` request
and opens `*Arxana Store Ping*`, showing sync status, base URL, timeout, proxy
settings, the last request, last error, and the response body. This is the
fastest way to confirm whether the HTTP bridge is working.

If you want a post‑mortem without making a new HTTP call, use
`M-x arxana-store-last-request-report`. It renders the last request/error state
in `*Arxana Store Last Request*` so you can see what failed and why.

* Fold debugging scripts
`dev/debug-fold-output.el` and `dev/debug-fold-props.el` are small scripts for
inspecting flexiarg folding behavior. They load flexiarg mode, prepare a sample
flexiarg file, and print either the visible buffer snippet or the overlay
properties after folding. Use these when metadata/context overlays don’t render
as expected.

* When to use what
- Use the store diagnostics when Futon calls time out or return unexpected
  data.
- Use the fold debug scripts when flexiarg metadata or context folding appears
  broken or inconsistent.
