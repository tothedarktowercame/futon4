* Context
1. Verify `futon4-enable-sync` is non-nil and rerun the command that failed.
2. Inspect `arxana-store-last-error` to see the HTTP method, reason, and any
   context when a request returns `nil`.
3. Use the relation browser commands above to confirm Futon is returning the
   data you expect; the buffer will show âNo data returned from Futonâ when the
   server was unreachable.
4. Run the adjacency unit tests to prove scholium links are mirrored correctly:

   ```bash
   HOME=$PWD/.home-tmp EMACS_NATIVE_COMPILATION=0 emacs --batch \
     -l arxana/dev/bootstrap.el \
     -l arxana/test/arxana-adjacency-test.el \
     -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit
   ```

   These tests stub the network layer and assert that `futon4--sync-about-links`
   calls the new store helpers with derived ids, so failures often indicate an
   unexpected change in the hook wiring.
