* Overview
Bootstrap sets up load paths and pulls in the dev modules. The current workflow
loads `dev/` directly rather than tangling a monolith, but the entry points keep
legacy compatibility.

* bootstrap.el and bootstrap2.el
`dev/bootstrap.el` defines the repo root, adds `dev/` to `load-path`, checks the
Emacs version, and loads key modules. `dev/bootstrap2.el` simply delegates to
bootstrap.el so older callers still work.

* Build commands
`arxana-build` is an alias for `arxana-load`, which loads the dev modules and
prints “Loaded dev/ modules”. The `C-u` prefix is accepted for compatibility but
no longer forces a tangle in the current workflow.

* Load order
Bootstrap ensures core packages (Org, JSON, URL) are available before requiring
Arxana modules. This keeps docbook, store, and browser functionality available
regardless of where you run the load from.

* Verifying the build
Run `M-x arxana-load` and check for the “Loaded dev/ modules” message. If a
module fails to load, inspect `*Messages*` for require errors and confirm your
Emacs version meets `arxana-minimum-emacs-version`.
