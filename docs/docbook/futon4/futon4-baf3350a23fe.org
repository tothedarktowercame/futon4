* Overview
Org import is the onboarding path for existing notes. It reads `.org` files,
creates local articles, and (when sync is enabled) registers them in Futon.

* Step-by-step
1. For a single file, run `M-x arxana-import-org-file` and select the `.org`.
2. For a batch, run `M-x arxana-import-org-directory` and choose a directory.
3. Use a prefix argument to enable recursive directory scanning.
4. The importer extracts the title or uses the filename to name the article.
5. Each article is stored locally and synced to Futon if enabled.

* How names are derived
`arxana-import--derive-name` prefers a `#+TITLE` header. If none exists, it uses
`file-name-base` and then the full filename. This keeps the import stable even
for minimal Org files.

* Existing names
If an article name already exists, the import will overwrite that entry in the
local table. For safety, verify the derived names before importing large
batches.

* Verification
Use `M-x arxana-store-ping` or the XTDB browser to confirm the imported entity
exists. For a single article, check `/entity/<id>` where the id comes from
`futon4--article-id-for`.
