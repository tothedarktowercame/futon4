* Context
The Emacs Lisp implementation in this repository provides:

- Interactive creation and editing of articles and scholia.
- Browsing modes over the in-memory graph.
- Operations for inclusion, derivation, and provenance as events.
- Import/export for specific document formats (historically LaTeX/Org).

Internally, it maintains the logical model in memory and (optionally)
syncs with external substrates (files, SQL backend).
