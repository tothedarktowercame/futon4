* Overview
The docbook browser UI is the primary way to navigate generated documentation.
It presents a book list, then a book view that splits into Contents and Recent.
From there you can drill into headings, open entry stubs for editing, and manage
ordering and exports.

* Navigation flow
1. Open the Arxana Browser and choose Docs.
2. Select a book (for example, futon4).
3. Choose Contents (outline order) or Recent (latest entries).
4. Selecting a heading drills into its section; selecting an entry opens the
   editable stub when available.

* Entry rendering and stubs
Entries appear in a tabulated list with title, status, and timestamps. If a
filesystem stub exists, the browser opens that stub directly so edits happen on
the working copy rather than a JSON snapshot.

* Reordering and section drill-down
Use M-<up>/M-<down> (or the section variants) to reorder entries in the contents
view. The browser tracks order overrides and can sync them back to storage.

* Marks, remove, delete
The contents view supports marking items for batch operations. Marks persist
across refresh, so you can collect headings and then remove or hard delete them
in one action.

* Export and sync
From the docbook views you can export to Org or PDF and sync order changes to
remote storage. The header line reflects dirty status so you can see when local
reordering needs to be pushed.
