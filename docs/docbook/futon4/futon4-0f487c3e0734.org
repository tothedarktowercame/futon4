* Overview
The XTDB browser is a lightweight audit view for recent Futon activity. It
presents the `/tail` feed in a tabulated list so you can scan the latest
relations without writing curl commands. This is useful for debugging sync
issues, confirming that transactions landed, or inspecting recent edges.

* Recent relations via `/tail`
`arxana-xtdb-browse` calls `arxana-store-tail`, which fetches the `/tail`
endpoint and caches the response. The browser normalizes whatever shape Futon
returns (`:relations`, `:links`, or `:items`) into a list of relation rows, each
with source, target, relation type, and last-seen timestamp.

* Inspecting entities and relations
From the list view, RET opens the ego report for the relation at point. The
source and target entity names are displayed as “name (type)” in the list, and
entity ids are available for deeper inspection. Use the source/target commands
to open those entities directly; `arxana-store-fetch-entity` is used to render
full payloads in a separate buffer.

* Limits and refresh
The default limit is controlled by `arxana-xtdb-browse-default-limit`, and you
can change it interactively with `l`. Refresh (`g`) re-runs the `/tail` query and
updates the table. The raw `/tail` response can be viewed with `R` for
troubleshooting.
