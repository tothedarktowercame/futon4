* Step-by-step
1. In the Arxana Browser, navigate to a pattern language or collection.
2. Press RET on a pattern to open it in an Org buffer.
3. Edit the summary block and component sections.
4. Press `g` to refresh from the source if you need to discard local edits.
5. Press `C-c C-s` to save changes back to Futon (and update components).

* Summary block and provenance
Each pattern buffer includes a `#+BEGIN_SUMMARY` … `#+END_SUMMARY` section for
the summary text. The header area also includes identifiers such as the pattern
id, title, and order to keep provenance visible while editing. These fields are
preserved when you save; only the summary and component bodies are updated.

* What gets synced
`arxana-browser-patterns-save` updates the pattern entity itself and then
updates all existing component entities. New headings without a component id are
ignored, so they won’t create new components until the ingestion pipeline
assigns ids.

* Sync behavior
Saving requires sync to be enabled; otherwise the command errors. The sync
process updates the pattern entity and its components, then reports how many
components were written. For visual confirmation, use the browser status labels
or re-open the pattern to confirm the updated text.

* Testing after edits
After saving, re-open the pattern or refresh the browser list to ensure the
summary and components are visible. For filesystem-backed patterns, verify the
local flexiarg file timestamps to confirm your edits are now the preferred
source.
