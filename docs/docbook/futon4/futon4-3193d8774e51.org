* Context
- `M-x arxana-relations-show-ego` renders the `/ego/:name` response in the
  `*Arxana Relations*` buffer, splitting outgoing vs incoming links.
- `M-x arxana-relations-show-cooccur` formats `/cooccur/:name` so you can spot
  frequently paired entities without leaving Emacs.
- `M-x arxana-relations-show-tail` displays the `/tail` feed (most recent
  relations) with confidence + timestamp notes.

Each of these commands relies on the `arxana-store-*` helpers above, so they
honour the same failure handling and record diagnostics in
`arxana-store-last-error` when Futon is unreachable.

The hyperedge helper is exercised via the scholium adjacency tests
(`arxana/test/arxana-adjacency-test.el`), which stub the HTTP layer and verify
that inclusion / transclusion scholia emit source, target, passage, and
provenance endpoints before hitting `/hyperedge`.  Snapshot save/restore flows
are covered by `arxana/test/arxana-saving-test.el`, ensuring the Emacs commands
call `/snapshot` and `/snapshot/restore` with the selected scope.  The
Org importer/exporter are covered by `arxana/test/arxana-import-test.el` and
`arxana/test/arxana-export-test.el`, guaranteeing that `.org` bundles can round-trip
through XTDB snapshots.
