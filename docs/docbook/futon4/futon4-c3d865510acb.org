* Context
- provide 'flexiarg: Declares the flexiarg feature after loading the contrib implementation, making this debug script act as a minimal integration shim so other code can `(require 'flexiarg)` during development without installing the package formally.
- arxana-flexiarg-collection-mode: Activates the core Arxana flexiarg collection minor/major mode inside a temporary buffer, establishing syntax, overlays, and analysis hooks needed to parse and visualize flexiarg documents during debugging.
- arxana-flexiarg--prepare-buffer: Initializes the temp buffer with a specific `.flexiarg` document path, triggering parsing and metadata/context overlay construction; this is the primary entry point for loading real documents into the analysis pipeline.
- arxana-flexiarg-show-conclusions: Renders computed conclusions from the prepared flexiarg document, exercising the presentation layer that turns internal argument structures into user-visible overlays.
- overlay-get (metadata/context overlays): Inspects the `display` property of the first metadata and context overlays, logging their rendered forms to messages; this validates fold/display behavior and is the core diagnostic check performed by this script.
