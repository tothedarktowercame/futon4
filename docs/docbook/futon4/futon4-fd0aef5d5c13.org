* Overview
Region scholia attach commentary to a specific span of text instead of the
entire article. This is the precise form of annotation used by transclusion and
passage-level discussion.

* How to create a region scholium
1. Select a region in the current article buffer.
2. Run `M-x arxana-scholium-compose-from-region`.
3. The helper calls `make-scholium-about-part-of-current-article` to capture the
   bounds and open the scholium buffer.
4. Enter the scholium text and publish with `C-c C-c`.

* What gets recorded
The region bounds are stored in the scholium “about” payload. When synced, the
resulting hyperedge includes a passage endpoint so provenance can point back to
that exact span, not just the whole article.
