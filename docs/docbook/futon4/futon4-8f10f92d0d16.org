* Overview
Co-occurrence queries find entities that appear together with a given name.
`arxana-store-cooccur` calls `/cooccur/:name` and returns rows with counts that
rank related entities by frequency.

* How counts are used
Counts are the number of times two entities appear together in relation data.
Higher counts suggest stronger topical proximity or repeated annotation patterns.

* Practical usage
Use co-occurrence to discover related articles, cluster themes, or validate that
new annotations are linking the intended entities. For a UI view, pair this with
the relations browser or XTDB browser output.
