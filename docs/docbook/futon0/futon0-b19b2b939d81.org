* Overview
Futon0 ships user-scoped systemd unit files that keep core automation tasks
running without manual scripts. They orchestrate recorder ingest, git
vitality refreshes, filesystem scanning, and negative space reminders.

* Zoom R4 ingest units
`zoom-mount.path` watches the recorder UUID, `zoom-mount.service` mounts the
card and ensures a stable `/media/joe/R4_SD` path, and `zoom-sync.service`
runs a single ingest pass before unmounting the card. This prevents repeat
runs until the card is replugged.

* Vitality and git timers
`user-git-vitality.timer` runs `scripts/git_vitality_sync.sh` hourly so the
git activity HUD feed stays fresh. `user-vitality-scanner.timer` runs the
filesystem scanner and publishes `latest_scan.json` for Futon3.

* Negative space timers
Optional `negative-*` timers fire reminders for Tai Chi and curfew windows.
These call `scripts/negative_space_notify.py` and can be enabled or disabled
independently.
