* Overview
`f2.musn` owns system start/stop and wiring. It constructs the transport,
optional REPL modules, and Tatami store, and it exposes helpers to load demo
events for development.

* Configuration
`musn/start!` accepts a map of options (for example `:repl` or `:drawbridge`)
that gates SAFE/ADMIN evals, outbound adapters, and logging behavior. The
`make dev` target uses the same entry point.
