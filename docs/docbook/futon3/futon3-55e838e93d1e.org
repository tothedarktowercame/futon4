* Context
This module builds Fulab-friendly PSR/PUR records for MUSN sessions. The
helpers produce anchors (`turn-anchor`, `pattern-action-anchor`) and the
standard forecast block used to justify selections. `build-psr` collects
candidates, rejections, certificates, and optional reasons into a PSR payload.
`build-pur` builds the parallel use record with the traceability fields.

`summary-event` wraps AIF summary results into the lab event format used by the
service layer. The service uses these helpers to keep traceability payloads
consistent across HTTP and lab exports.
