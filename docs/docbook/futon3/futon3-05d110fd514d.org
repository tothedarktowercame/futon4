* Context
`futon3.pattern-hints` builds sigil- and embedding-based recommendations for
patterns, fruits, and paramitas. It scans the flexiarg library and devmaps to
collect pattern summaries and sigils, then scores candidates by emoji/hanzi
distance against the target sigils.

When embeddings are available, GloVe neighbors are merged with the sigil
results to broaden the candidate set. `hints` is the primary entry point: it
resolves target sigils from explicit sigils or prototypes, computes pattern
candidates, and returns nearby fruit/paramita entries for UI display.

The module also exposes helper collections (all patterns, fruit definitions,
paramita definitions) that other components use for intent seeding.
