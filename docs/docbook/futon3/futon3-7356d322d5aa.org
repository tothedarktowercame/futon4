* Overview
`futon3.stack.status` builds the Stack HUD payload. It merges vitality scans,
boundary snapshots, git summaries, Tatami status, and reminder data into a
single report used by the HUD and API callers.

* Consumers
The Tatami context pane and HUD views read this status report to surface
missing evidence warnings, storage alerts, and daily reminders alongside
session summaries.
