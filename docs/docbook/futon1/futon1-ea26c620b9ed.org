* Overview
`apps/nlp-interface` provides the deterministic NLP stack shared by every
Futon1 entry point. It combines tokenization, NER/POS tagging, a gazetteer,
and pattern recognition to produce stable, testable extracts.

* Outputs
The pipeline yields normalized token and mention maps plus relation
candidates that feed the ingest pipeline. Pronouns such as "I" and "you" are
intentionally ignored unless later resolved by a dedicated pass.

* Determinism
The interface is designed to be repeatable: the same input text should
always emit the same entities and relations so downstream focus headers and
XTDB snapshots remain stable.
