* Overview
`ants.aif.affect` models hunger dynamics and precision modulation. It keeps
ant internal state consistent across ticks and ties energy balance to
decision temperature.

* Hunger model
Hunger rises with metabolic burn, load, and distance from home, and falls
when the ant gathers or deposits food or rests on the nest. Hive reserves
provide a shared buffer before starvation triggers termination.

* Precision modulation
The affect step adjusts modulation factors that influence the predictive
coding step and the policy softmax, so the agent becomes more exploratory or
focused as hunger changes.
