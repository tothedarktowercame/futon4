* Overview
The terminal HUD lives in `ants.ui`. It prints per-tick scoreboard lines with
the classic vs AIF score, tick counter, expected free energy EMA, hive
reserves, and most recent actions.

* Usage
The HUD is used by the CLI (`clj -M:run`) and can be disabled by passing
`{:hud? false}` to `ants.war/simulate` for quiet programmatic runs.
