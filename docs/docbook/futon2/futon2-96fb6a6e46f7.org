* Overview
Scenario orchestration lives in `ants.war/run` and `ants.war/simulate`. These
helpers build the initial world, spawn hives, and run the tick loop until a
termination condition is reached.

* Termination and reporting
The loop stops on starvation, total ant death, or a configured tick limit.
Each tick can emit HUD lines, and the final summary includes scores and
reserve levels for both factions.

* Configuration
`ants.war/default-config` exposes grid size, ants-per-side, hunger tuning,
and tick count. CLI aliases (`clj -M:run`, `clj -M:viz`) simply override these
config keys.
