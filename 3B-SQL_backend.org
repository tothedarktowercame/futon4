* SQL backend                                                      :noexport:

This branch captures the alternative storage design from
=arxana-reboot=, where scholia live in SQL tables while Common Lisp
(via SLIME) acts as the application server that Emacs calls through
`Defun'.  Subsections 3B.1+ summarize the schema and Lisp-side
utilities so we can compare or mix and match pieces with the HONEY
backend (Section 3A) and the original hash-store (Section 3).
