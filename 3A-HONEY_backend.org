** Overview of the backend

This backend is a Higher Order NEtwork Yarnknotter or HONEY for short.
It stores a \emph{network} of quintuplets of the form
\kw{(uid label source sink . content)}.  One such quintuplet is called a
\emph{nema}.  The structure of an individual nema is as follows: The
\kw{uid} is a numeric identifier that is unique on a network
basis.  The \kw{label} is an (optional) string that corresponds
uniquely to the uid.  The \kw{source} is the nema (identified by
uid) to the ``left'' of our quintuplet, and the \kw{sink} is the
uid to the ``right'' of our quintuplet.  One or both may be \kw{0}, and in case both are, the nema is understood to be a
\emph{node}.  Lastly, the nema's \kw{content} can be any Lisp
object -- including another nema in the same network or another
network.\todo{(Check this last statement...)}
