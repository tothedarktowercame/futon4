*** The joys and sorrows of editing `about' data

As noted in [[id:consistency-editing]], changes to \inp{about} data can
have broad ramifications.  In addition to masking any explicit links
that point at this data, we will have to change everything that uses
link-id's. 

In particular, backlinks corresponding to the set of edited links will
have to change.  I think that this part at least can be accomplished
by running `scholium-modified-about-hook' (cf. Note
[[id:hooks-for-new-and-modified-scholia]] and Note
[[id:put-backlinks]]).

We'll have to decide whether it is worth our trouble to change markup
(it would seem to be inavoidable; however, as a quick work-around,
perhaps other renderings can simply be blanked out when \inp{about}
data is being edited).
