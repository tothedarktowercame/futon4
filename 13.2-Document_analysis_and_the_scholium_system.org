*** Pitfalls of summarization

It isn't completely clear that Note [[id:the-philosophy]] makes a great
summary of the whole of the philosophy of this work.  Any summary
leaves things out or is otherwise vague.


*** Recapitulation

An article $A$ that appears after some article $B$ in a given ordering
which contains a summary of $B$.  This relationship could be indicated
by a link in one direction or another (likely to run from $A$ to $B$).


*** Discourse analysis and holographic or monadological structures

Long-range reference and design theory seem related to each other and
to this work as a whole; cf. Section [[id:mathematics]].


*** Unified semantics

Nelson (I think) has advertised some kind of unified theory of
semantics; it might be fun to take a look at that.
