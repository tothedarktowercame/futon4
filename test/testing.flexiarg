@allow-new-claims true
@order 1

! conclusion:
  Set expectations that the paper distills conceptual lessons from simulated
  workshops rather than unveiling a production-ready system, while signalling the
  three analytic lenses that anchor the rest of the text.

  + CONTEXT:
    We ran narrative-rich GPT workshops to probe how PLACARD-era pattern methods
    behave when orchestrated by virtual facilitators and fictional agents.

  + IF:
    Readers know that these simulations served as thinking tools, not
    deliverables, and that we will repeatedly view them through Project Action
    Reviews, Causal Layered Analysis, and a simple “next steps” clause that keeps
    patterns curious.

  + HOWEVER:
    Without a clear preface, reviewers might expect implementation detail or
    empirical validation we cannot provide, or assume the analytic lenses are new
    inventions rather than familiar practices applied in concert.

  + THEN:
    Open with a candid statement: the prototypes shaped our understanding, the
    paper gathers the resulting insights, and the trio of lenses will be used as
    interpretive tools throughout.

  + BECAUSE:
    Front-loading intent keeps the scope legible, prevents reviewers from
    chasing missing code, and frames each later section as part of a reflective
    synthesis instead of a systems pitch.

  + NEXT STEPS:
    Draft the prefatory paragraphs using plain, fairy-tale language that names
    the simulations, introduces the lenses, and emphasizes that what follows is a
    distillation meant for designers and educators alike.

@title Introduction: What a Pattern Wants
@audience plop-reviewers
@tone lucid
@allow-new-claims true
@order 2

! conclusion:
  Introduce design patterns as living predictive cells that sense context,
  surface tensions, act, and keep a “next steps” clause to gather new evidence,
  while highlighting PAR and CLA as complementary bundles for coordinating them.

  + CONTEXT:
    Readers arrive with varied notions of “pattern”—some think of catalogues,
    others of reusable code—and need a story that links the PLACARD lineage to
    present-day questions about agency and pedagogy.

  + IF:
    We render a pattern as a Jeff Hawkins-style neuron—firing when context and
    tension align, dampening noise, and triggering action—and explain that the
    added “next steps” clause keeps it collecting evidence over time.

  + HOWEVER:
    Too much machinery (predictive processing jargon, PAR/CLA mechanics) could
    swamp the introduction, obscuring the reader-friendly story before it begins.

  + THEN:
    Use simple metaphors: PAR is the with-the-grain bundle that gathers agents in
    a shared moment; CLA is the across-the-grain bundle that rewrites the story;
    together, they keep a collection of patterns healthy as they learn.

  + BECAUSE:
    This framing shows why patterns matter beyond documentation—they are active
    participants in inquiry—and primes readers for the rest of the paper without
    demanding technical background.

  + NEXT STEPS:
    Draft two concise introduction paragraphs that (1) define patterns via the
    neuron metaphor plus the curiosity clause, and (2) preview PAR and CLA as the
    lenses we use to understand how patterns travel through workshops and futures.

@order 3

! conclusion:
  Explain how virtual workshops, reflective instrumentation, and
  prototype-inspired thought experiments provided qualitative evidence for the
  analysis, while setting expectations about abductive reasoning.

  + CONTEXT:
    The paper relies on simulated dialogues, in-person workshop notes, and the
    authors’ ongoing prototyping practice; reviewers need to know how these
    strands interact.

  + IF:
    We describe the segmentation protocol for the GPT workshops, the reflective
    logs and PAR/CLA artefacts that grounded interpretation, and the way
    prototype work informed but did not dominate our reasoning.

  + HOWEVER:
    Listing methods without clarifying their qualitative, abductive nature could
    invite demands for replicable metrics or system benchmarks.

  + THEN:
    Characterise the methods as narrative instruments: the virtual workshops are
    staged conversations; the PAR/CLA materials are living notebooks; the
    prototype efforts are thought experiments that shaped questions.

  + BECAUSE:
    This framing gives enough procedural detail to show rigor while keeping the
    ontology aligned with the paper’s reflective, design-oriented goals.

  + NEXT STEPS:
    Draft subsections for (1) staged workshops, (2) reflective instrumentation,
    and (3) prototype-informed interpretation, each ending with a note about the
    qualitative nature of the evidence.

! conclusion:
  Translate workshop insights into three design requirements—recognition,
  flexiformal expression, and reflection loops—showing why they matter for any
  future transition from simulated to embodied agents.

  + CONTEXT:
    Readers are curious about what happens if patterns stop being purely human
    artefacts and start living inside software or mixed collectives.

  + IF:
    We present each requirement as a “threshold” that the simulations illuminated
    (e.g., agents need to notice when a pattern should fire, interpret its clauses
    legibly, and keep it evolving via PAR/CLA-like loops).

  + HOWEVER:
    Getting lost in prototype detail would derail the reflective tone and invite
    requests for benchmarks.

  + THEN:
    Use narrative vignettes drawn from the simulations: describe what went right
    or wrong in a virtual breakout, extrapolate the requirement, and sketch what a
    cautious real-world implementation would have to respect.

  + BECAUSE:
    This lets us talk about why the simulated→real transition matters—accountable
    memory, transparent roles, living evidence—without overclaiming progress.

  + NEXT STEPS:
    Draft three subsections (Recognition, Flexiformality, Reflection) each with a
    vignette, a requirement statement, and a note about implications for future
    agent design.

@order 5

! conclusion:
  Show how the quadripartite view—interactional, organizational, actionable,
  environmental—emerged from the workshops, and how PAR, CLA, and the “next
  steps” clause diagnose tensions in each layer.

  + CONTEXT:
    Workshop vignettes revealed recurrent stresses: sensing together, sharing
    facilitation roles, landing actionable moves, and tending to the environment
    that holds the patterns.

  + IF:
    We tell short stories for each quadrant, highlighting where a pattern fired,
    where it faltered, and how a PAR or CLA move exposed what was missing.

  + HOWEVER:
    Without discipline, this section could balloon into illustrative anecdotes
    that do not add analytic value.

  + THEN:
    For each quadrant, pick one concrete moment (two real, two simulated is fine)
    and walk the reader through how the pattern behaved, what the reflective
    instrument revealed, and what “next steps” the pattern recorded for itself.

  + BECAUSE:
    This keeps the section grounded, demonstrates how the analytic trio works in
    practice, and sets up the later move toward pattern-competent agents.

  + NEXT STEPS:
    Outline four subsections (A–D) with one paragraph each: scene, diagnosis via
    PAR/CLA/next-steps, lesson for refining the pattern ecology.

@order 6

! conclusion:
  Outline design requirements for lesson plans that mirror the agent
  requirements: neuron-like pattern drills, paired PAR/CLA activities, flexiformal
  writing, and reflective instrumentation.

  + CONTEXT:
    We lack time to test curricula, but the simulations suggest what future
    learners would need to practice if they are to steward pattern ecologies with
    or without computational collaborators.

  + IF:
    We treat lessons as ensembles of small active inference loops: students learn
    when a pattern fires, why it might fail, how to reframe it across layers, and
    how to note “next steps” evidence.

  + HOWEVER:
    Without a concise structure, this section could read like an afterthought or
    a speculative rant.

  + THEN:
    Mirror the agent thresholds: explain the exercise, the reflective instrument
    it pairs with, and how it prepares students for computational or human
    collaboration.

  + BECAUSE:
    This symmetry shows that pedagogy and tooling share constraints and makes the
    section feel integral rather than appendical.

  + NEXT STEPS:
    Draft a short section with four bullet-style subsections (Recognition drills,
    PAR studios, CLA remixes, Flexiformal journaling), each linked to a sample
    exercise and its intended “next steps” habit.

! conclusion:
  Reflect on the limitations of simulated evidence, articulate the ethical stakes
  of moving toward real agents, and outline near-term commitments that keep the
  pattern ecology honest.

  + CONTEXT:
    The paper closes with enthusiasm tempered by awareness: we have not deployed
    the systems we imagine, but we have concrete practices to evolve.

  + IF:
    We revisit key limitations (simulation, lack of classroom pilots, dependence
    on narrative inference) and translate them into future work commitments.

  + HOWEVER:
    A generic future-work list would feel detached from the analytic arc we’ve
    built.

  + THEN:
    Tie each commitment to the triple analysis: richer “next steps” instrumentation
    for patterns, hybrid workshops that test PAR/CLA bundles with partial agent
    support, and curricular pilots that treat patterns as living agents.

  + BECAUSE:
    This keeps the narrative coherent and shows reviewers that we understand the
    ethical and methodological boundaries of our current evidence.

  + NEXT STEPS:
    Draft a closing section with three paragraphs (limitations, commitments,
    ethical framing) and a sentence inviting collaboration from readers who want
    to explore the simulated→real transition responsibly
