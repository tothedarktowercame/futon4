It should be possible to reduce metadata and so on to some format that
would work with external programs (e.g. database programs).  I'm not
at all sure how the use of text properties would be replaced in other
programs, but I think that, in theory, the things we save (Section
[[id:saving-and-restoring]]) should be sufficient and readable for any
other interested program.  I'd be interested to know the thoughts of
others on building other interfaces to the scholium system.
