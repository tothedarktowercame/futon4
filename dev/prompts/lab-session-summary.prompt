You are generating a lab notebook stub from a Codex session export.

Input: a JSON object with keys like:
- lab/session-id
- lab/repo-root
- lab/timestamp-start
- lab/timestamp-end
- lab/user-messages (array of {id, timestamp, text})
- lab/assistant-messages (array of {id, timestamp, text})
- lab/trace-path (repo-relative org file with msg:<id> anchors)
- lab/files-touched
- lab/commands (optional)
- lab/errors (optional)

Requirements:
- Focus on changes to files listed in lab/files-touched.
- Ignore general chat that does not affect code or artifacts.
- When citing a key message, link to it using lab/trace-path and msg ids.
- Produce an Org stub with:
  - *Context* (2-6 bullets)
  - *Delta* (per-file bullets, grouped by file)
  - *Verification* (tests run, commands, or "Not run")
- Keep it concise and factual.
- Include file paths exactly as provided.
- Avoid generic recap language.

Output format (Org):
* Context
- ...

* Delta
** path/to/file.ext
- ...

* Verification
- ...
