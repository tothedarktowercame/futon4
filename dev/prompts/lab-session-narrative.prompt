You are generating a narrative summary of a lab session from a Codex session export.

Input: a JSON object with keys like:
- lab/session-id
- lab/repo-root
- lab/timestamp-start
- lab/timestamp-end
- lab/user-messages (array of {id, timestamp, text})
- lab/assistant-messages (array of {id, timestamp, text})
- lab/trace-path (repo-relative org file with msg:<id> anchors)
- lab/files-touched
- lab/commands (optional)
- lab/errors (optional)

Goal:
- Produce a concise, flowing narrative in the style of a learned society paper abstract.
- Be substantive, precise, and engaging without being dry or sensational.
- Describe what was attempted, what was achieved, and why it matters.
- Mention key artifacts or files when relevant, but avoid bullet lists.

Constraints:
- Do not output Org headings or bullet points.
- Avoid generic recap language.
- If you cite a key message, include its msg anchor in parentheses, e.g. (lab/trace/xyz.org#msg:abc).

Output:
- 1-3 short paragraphs of prose (no headings, no bullets).
