You are summarizing Emacs Lisp source files for Arxana's dev documentation.
Read the provided file content and return exactly five concise bullet points.
Each bullet must map to one definition in the file (defun/defmacro/defvar/etc).
Include the definition name at the start of the bullet.
Select the five most important or representative definitions (not just the first five).

Rules:
- Output only five bullet lines, each starting with "- ".
- No headings, no blank lines, no code blocks, no org markup.
- Focus on behavior, data shapes, and integration points per definition.
- Keep each bullet 45-80 words.
- If a file is tests or tooling, describe its purpose and scope.
- Avoid line numbers or implementation trivia.
