#+TODO: TODO(t) WIP(w!) READY(r!) | DONE(d!)

This file records every `.el` change that still needs to be mirrored into
`arxana/latex/org/`.  Keep it close to reality: as soon as a change feels
production-bound (not a throwaway experiment), add an entry.

* Usage

- Create a new heading under *Backlog* per feature/namespace that needs a
  literate counterpart; set its TODO keyword to `TODO`.
- Use the property drawer to list the relevant Lisp files, target Org file or
  heading, and any breadcrumbs (commit hash, link to discussion, etc.).
- Advance the keyword to `WIP` when someone actively ports the code, `READY` when
  the Org section is up-to-date and pending verification, and finally `DONE`
  once the breadcrumb comments are removed from the `.el`.
- Feel free to add subheadings if a namespace spans multiple Org targets.
- Keep descriptions short but specific so reviewers can confirm coverage.

* Review checklist

1. Does the change introduce or modify public APIs, data shapes, or behavior?
2. If yes, is there a corresponding entry below with files, targets, and notes?
3. Do the touched `.el` files include `;; TODO(org-sync): …` pointers?
4. Once the Org port is confirmed, mark the entry `READY` (awaiting review) or
   `DONE` (fully merged) and delete the in-file TODO markers.

* Backlog

** TODO Example entry (replace me)
   :FILES: dev/arxana-store.el
   :TARGET: arxana/latex/org/3B.2.2-Main_table_definitions.org
   :NOTES: Commit <hash>; store transactions + new attributes

This placeholder shows the preferred structure.  Replace it with real entries as
soon as new work lands.
