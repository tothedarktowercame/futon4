*** Crosscut by users and dates

A simple scheme for facilitating interactions between several users is
as follows.  Each user gets a directory to call their own.  Each users
scholia for the day are stored in a file in this directory.  To catch
up with the activities of all users, one simply loads all of the files
that have appeared since the last load date.

To implement this scheme, we need a method for populating the
data-store and another for scanning it to determine which files to
load.  

We'll assume that only the scholia that bear a certain label (say ``to
publish'') will be published, and that once they have been published,
this label is wiped out (maybe it is set to ``last published'').  In
general, the ``to publish'' set could be determined by some somewhat
complicated algorithm, not just by looking at a label.  

Also, we should presumably maintain all of the imported scholia in a
namespace (most likely, certainly some subcollection) in order to keep
them straight.  (For a first draft, we could just import everything to
the main article table, given that namespaces don't completely work
yet.)

Presumably we should start by building the infrastructure in our CVS
directory.  (Some more general formulation that allows collaboration
between different people writing to disparate locations online would
be good to have eventually; to support this we'll want some sort of
protocol, maybe something like RSS.)


*** Networked blotters

Keeping one another up to date on the important features of daily
goings on is an important use of the multiuser system.  The notion
that each user would maintain some sort of ``blotter'', possibly
incorporating some auto-generated content, which others can read to
stay in the loop.


*** Strategic usefulness of building and using collaboration tools early on

While we could ask people to work on other things first (and to some
extent it will be necessary for people to work on other things all
along the way) it seems likely that using powerful collaboration tools
will help people get things done on other projects or subprojects.
When many people can share differing views on a topic, the discussions
of this topic will develop a richness that wouldn't be so likely to
develop otherwise.  A system that can take into account many views in
a coherent and useful way is going to be a powerful system.  (It would
be good to do some research on the differing abilities of various
extant systems to accomplish this.)

Collaboration is a challenging thing to deal with.  You have greenhorn
or yahoo types who want to charge off and do things on their own (I'm
often one of them), and in the mean time, you don't always have a
central point for collaboration on some topic where you might hope one
would be.  It isn't always clear when you have a certain vision
whether there are others out there who would share that vision or not.
Partly, that's because when you have a vision it isn't always
completely clear what that vision is; but these things interact.
