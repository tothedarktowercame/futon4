** Outside references

For now, references are contained in footnotes.  To view a compilation
of the Notes that contain footnotes, evaluate this form:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle no
(progn (article-menu-list-articles-matching-regexp "\\footnote")
  (listing-to-compilation nil))
#+END_SRC
Eventually we may have a nicer way of presenting this data.  Also,
there are a number of references made in the text for which there are
no footnotes, and the footnotes that do exist don't necessarily take a
proper or in any way standard form.  This can be fixed up eventually.
