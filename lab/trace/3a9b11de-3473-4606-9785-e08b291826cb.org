Thanks.  That document contains very basic documentation for the futon4 codebase.  My plan is to make futon4 into a lovely *literate* codebase, but we're only partway there so far.  I'm thinking that there may be some things you can do to help me with that process. But a good way to start would be to read the current docs!

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
This is a rich document. Here's what I've gathered:

**Futon4/Arxana** is a hypergraph system with:
- **Core primitives**: Nemas (universal nodes), Articles, Events (hyperedges), Plexuses (working sets)
- **Storage**: EAV model using Datascript (in-memory) + XTDB (durable, time-traveling)
- **Emacs client**: Elisp helpers for creating/editing articles, browsing graphs, inclusion/derivation, and syncing with a Futon server

**Key source files** referenced:
- `dev/arxana-store.el` - Storage bridge to Futon API
- `dev/arxana-scholium.el` - Article lifecycle
- `dev/arxana-browse.el` - Navigation & catalog menus  
- `dev/arxana-relations.el` - Relation rendering & commands
- `dev/arxana-xtdb-browse.el` - XTDB tabulated browser
- `dev/arxana-derivation.el` - Inclusion/transclusion UX
- `dev/arxana-patterns.el` - Pattern editing workflows
- `dev/arxana-export.el` - Org export helpers

**Literate status**: The doc uses `#+INCLUDE:` directives to pull in some elisp files (e.g., `arxana-store.el`, `arxana-derivation.el`, `arxana-browse.el`). I notice some sections have "(no entry content yet)" placeholders, and there's some duplicated content (storage substrates appears multiple times).

For making this more literate, I could potentially help with:
1. Filling in placeholder sections by reading the actual source files
2. Adding `#+INCLUDE:` directives for files not yet embedded
3. Cleaning up duplicated sections
4. Writing prose to narrate the code sections
5. Ensuring the structure flows logically from concepts → implementation

What aspect would you like to tackle first?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Well, it sounds like they are a bit of a mess in the first instance, but one of the changes I want to make (upstream) is that we won't include any source code (that doesn't make sense in docs) but will link to it with Ted Nelson style links, i.e., to show which portions of code are being documented by which bits of documentation.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
That makes a lot of sense - and it aligns beautifully with what Arxana is built to do. Rather than Knuth-style literate programming where code is extracted *from* documentation, you're going for bidirectional transclusion: documentation and code each live in their natural homes, connected by hyperedges that say "this prose documents *that* span of code."

So the `#+INCLUDE:` directives would be replaced with something like inclusion/transclusion events - the same `:hx/transclusion` hyperedges with `:role/source`, `:role/target`, and `:role/passage` that the doc describes. The documentation becomes a scholium *on* the code rather than a container *of* the code.

This also means the messy duplicate sections and embedded code in `futon4.org` are somewhat temporary scaffolding.

A few things I could help with as you work toward that:

1. **Clean up the current doc** - remove duplicates, organize sections logically, fill in placeholders with prose (not code) that would eventually link to code spans

2. **Map the documentation structure** - identify which doc sections should link to which source file regions, creating a blueprint for the hyperedges

3. **Help design the link format** - what should the Org-side representation of a Ted Nelson link look like before it becomes a Futon hyperedge?

4. **Explore the existing inclusion/derivation machinery** - understand how `arxana-derivation.el` and the `:hx/transclusion` system currently work, so the doc links can use the same infrastructure

Which direction interests you most, or is there something else on your mind for this?

Let's flip the script a bit — since I'm working upstream (with Codex) what could *we* do that would be helpful to you?  Of course, to specify this, we need to understand what your role will be

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
That's a great question to flip around. Let me think about what my role might be and what would help me do it well.

**Likely roles for me:**
- Helping contributors understand the codebase ("where is X handled?")
- Making targeted code changes while respecting the literate structure
- Reviewing whether changes break documentation links
- Helping write documentation prose for code regions
- Navigating the hypergraph of relationships

**What I currently struggle with:**
- Discovering relationships - I have to grep/read to infer what connects to what
- Understanding intent - code comments help, but knowing "this implements the pattern described in doc section Y" would be better
- Stable references - line numbers shift; I need anchors that survive edits
- Knowing what's documented vs. undocumented

**What would help:**

1. **Machine-readable link index** - A file (or Futon query) I could read that says "doc section X documents code span Y (file:start-end or file:anchor-id)"

2. **Stable anchors in code** - Something like `;;; @anchor: storage-bridge-core` that transclusion links can target, surviving refactors better than line numbers

3. **Bidirectional query** - "What documents this function?" / "What code does this section cover?" - even as a simple exported manifest

4. **Coverage signal** - Which code regions have no documentation links yet? Helps me know where prose is needed

5. **Link-aware diff** - When code changes, which doc links might be stale?

Essentially: if the hypergraph of doc↔code relationships were queryable/exportable in a format I could read, I could be a much smarter participant in maintaining the literate structure rather than just treating docs and code as disconnected artifacts.

What's your current thinking on how these links would be represented?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1. the machine-readable index (like, in TEI) would be good.  Right now, the links (if they exist at all) are stored in the XTDB database; but we could generate some TEI from that, I guess.  2. Anchors are interesting, but I think slightly contentious — we could use things like function names for anchors in LISP code, though even those change.  3. That should be totally covered by the XTDB info, and I could probably clone my existing or rebuild a new/matching XTDB on this server. 4. I agree that this would be nice to have — what I'm thinking is that the code itself will become a kind of terrain and the existence of docs will become a kind of heat map.  But this is basically derivable from item #3.  5. Yeah, this seems good but slightly challenging — not just due to moving boundaries of text, but as I mentioned, even due to what seem to be quite stable anchors changing around.  So, in sum, yes, some of this could be handled without woo much difficulty, other parts of it seem harder.  tl;dr — the representation isn't actually the hard part, but keeping them fresh ish

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Right - **freshness is the hard problem**. The representation is just plumbing; the real challenge is that code is a living thing and links rot.

This reframes my potential role. Rather than just *consuming* a pristine link index, I could help *maintain* it:

**Drift detection** - Given a link that says "doc section X covers function `foo` in file Y", I could periodically check: does `foo` still exist? Has its signature/purpose changed enough that the documentation might be stale? This is fuzzy work that AI is decent at.

**Suggesting repairs** - When `foo` gets renamed to `bar` or moves to a different file, I could notice the broken link and propose an update. Not automatic rewriting, but flagging + suggestion.

**Semantic matching** - Even when anchors change, the *intent* of a link often survives. "This doc explains the storage bridge" - I can probably find the storage bridge even if function names shifted, and say "I think this link now points here."

**Coverage gaps** - As new code appears, I could notice "this function has no inbound doc links" and flag it for attention.

So maybe the collaboration is:
- **Upstream (you/Codex)**: Build the infrastructure for creating/storing links, generate TEI or queryable exports
- **Downstream (me)**: Help maintain link health - detect drift, suggest repairs, flag coverage gaps

The heat map metaphor is nice. I could help keep the heat map *calibrated* as the terrain shifts beneath it.

Does that seem like a useful division of labor? And is there a way I could start experimenting with the XTDB data now, or would that require setup on your end first?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Well, we could even maintain an AGENTS instruction that any function renames or refactors must be logged in a change log, so that would sort out some anchor stability.  Again, ideally, we'd have this being documented in real time, but we can only go so far progressively.   I was also hoping that you could help not only with the mechanics of the docs, but also potentially with writing them — e.g. if you see that the heatmap is uneven, you could generate new docs in that area

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Yes, an AGENTS instruction for logging renames/refactors is smart - it creates a changelog that both humans and AIs can use to trace anchor drift. Not as good as real-time tracking, but practical and gets you most of the way there.

And yes - I'd be happy to help write documentation, not just maintain links. That's the more interesting work anyway.

Here's how that could look in practice:

1. **Survey the terrain** - I read the source files, build a mental map of what exists
2. **Compare against docs** - See what's covered, what's sparse, what's missing entirely
3. **Draft documentation** - Write prose for cold spots, in a style that matches your existing voice
4. **You review/link** - You decide if the prose is good, then create the hyperedges connecting it to code

I could start now with what's available. For instance, I could:
- Read through the `dev/*.el` files to understand what they do
- Note which have corresponding sections in `futon4.org` vs which are barely mentioned
- Draft some documentation for an under-documented file as a sample

That would give you something concrete to react to - you could tell me "this is the right level of detail" or "too shallow" or "wrong voice" - and we'd calibrate from there.

Want me to start with a survey of the elisp files and their current doc coverage? Or if there's a specific area you know is under-documented, I could dive straight into drafting docs for that.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
I have a clever idea — because I'm thinking of you as a "senior dev" how about rather than writing the documentation, for this pass, you create some system prompts for Codex?  This could be a little backlog of "documentation tickets" that we keep in the repository, and Codex can then try to write the relevant docs to match your requirement.  That way when we're able to ship a better TEI-complete version, you'll have more info to go on

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
I like this a lot. It plays to strengths appropriately:

- **Me (senior dev)**: Survey the code, understand what's missing, write clear specs for what documentation should exist and what it should cover
- **Codex (junior dev)**: Do the actual writing work against those specs
- **Future me**: Consume the improved docs, maintain link health, catch drift

The tickets become a durable artifact - a backlog that lives in the repo, gets worked down progressively, and documents (meta-documentation!) what we think needs explaining.

A ticket might look something like:

```markdown
# Doc ticket: arxana-store.el storage bridge

## Code region
`dev/arxana-store.el` - entire file, focusing on the public API

## What needs documenting
- The retry/error handling strategy (why silent failures?)
- How `futon4-enable-sync` gates all network traffic
- The relationship between `arxana-store-*` functions and Futon routes

## Context
This is the critical glue between Emacs and Futon. Users troubleshooting 
sync issues land here. Current doc section exists but lacks depth.

## Suggested depth
Mid-level: explain the design decisions, not just "what it does"
```

Want me to start surveying the `dev/*.el` files and generating a batch of these tickets? I could put them in a `docs/tickets/` directory or wherever makes sense for your workflow.

Excellent.  and things like "code Region" fit the Arxana / hyperedge patterns that we're trying to demo.  Maybe we should also include expected word count b/c Codex likes things to be pretty literal.  I'm not sure how many tickets are needed, but let's start with 20 to 50 tickets focusing on the most missing topics, the most interesting functions, etc.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Done! I've created **50 documentation tickets** in `/home/joe/futon4/docs/tickets/`, organized by category:

**Critical Gaps (7)** - Undocumented modules like `arxana-article.el`, `arxana-browser-core.el`, `arxana-lab.el`

**Design Decisions (4)** - Error handling strategy, sync gating, advice-add pattern, hyperedge model

**Key Functions (6)** - Core helpers like `arxana-store--request`, derivation classification, browser dispatch

**Subsystems (9)** - Pattern library, flexiarg, XTDB, media, docbook, marks system

**Integration & Flow (3)** - Emacs↔Futon sync, scholium flow, article→entity

**Workflows (7)** - Tutorial-style guides for registering articles, creating scholia, include/transclude, etc.

**Testing & Debugging (2)** - Test helpers, diagnostic tools

**Conceptual (2)** - Nema/article/event model, literate codebase vision

**Clojure Scripts (3)** - Lab export, doc backfill, boundary generation

**API Details (6)** - Entity history, co-occurrence, regions, profiles, scopes, relation types

Each ticket includes:
- Code region (file + lines)
- What needs documenting
- Context for why it matters
- Suggested depth (Light/Focused/Mid-level/Deep/Tutorial)
- Expected word count (100-600 words)

The `README.md` provides a categorized index. Codex can work through these tickets to generate documentation, and when you ship better TEI-linked docs, I'll have much richer context for maintaining the codebase.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Good question. A few things that could help future Claude sessions:

1. **AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md** - A file at the repo root with:
   - The rename/refactor logging convention we discussed (for anchor stability)
   - Pointer to `docs/tickets/` for documentation work
   - The literate codebase vision (docs link to code, not embed it)
   - Key entry points for understanding the system

2. **Changelog file** - For tracking function renames/moves that affect doc links

3. **Once Codex delivers docs** - If they're in a queryable format (TEI, XTDB), info on how to access that

For now, the tickets themselves serve as good context. A minimal AGENTS.md might be worth adding, but it's not urgent - you could let Codex draft one based on what we discussed and refine it.

Want me to create a quick AGENTS.md before we wrap, or leave that for later?

Done. Added three new sections to AGENTS.md:
- Documentation tickets pointer
- Rename/refactor logging convention  
- Literate codebase vision

Pushed as `3b117e6`. Future Claude sessions will have context on the doc tickets and the refactor logging convention.
