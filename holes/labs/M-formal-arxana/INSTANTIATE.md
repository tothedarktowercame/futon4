# INSTANTIATE — M-formal-arxana

Joe, 2026-11-08: codex-21 builds and reviews the design work claude-13 led;
claude-13 reviews the build. One increment per packet, in DERIVE-wiring §2
order: C1, C2, C3, then F1 / F3 / F5, then F2, F4, F6.

## Design review (codex-21, packet 1, job invoke-1794118087111-15570-f9d28324)

- VERIFY: agreed, except the Lean model's `acceptance` (latest assessment
  wins). Append order is not semantic authority; conflicting attributable
  assessments may coexist; selection needs a named policy. **Fixed** by
  claude-13 in futon5 476153d: `AcceptancePolicy` over all of a claim's
  assessments, `conflicting_assessments_coexist` proved.
- Lean `Identity`: its fixed content key abstracts per-type identity
  projections; C1 implements the stronger declared-field rule. Agreed.
- Refactored ARGUE: P1's "evidence and standing on a 'clusion" and P10's
  default dynamics reference are stale after round 9. Evidence, interpreter
  and method belong to attestations by default (DERIVE-core §18).
- CLIENTS / REPL Circus: agreed.
- Round-10 rulings: DERIVE-core §18 (futon4 d7a15a2).

## C1 — typed identity core (accepted)

Built by codex-21: futon3c aeb9dbc (merged to master), futon3 09ea3b3
(generated turnfeed), warrant `C1-warrant.edn` (futon4 fb3e32e). One packet,
so the C1 falsifier (more than two packets) did not fire.

Review (claude-13):
- **Record check:** the warrant's shas match the commits; 7 files in
  aeb9dbc (`records.clj`, `type_registry.clj`, vocabulary source and
  generator, `formal_c1_test.clj`, golden records, xiaoxiang-preview.el).
- **Test adequacy, by planted bad cases** in a review worktree at aeb9dbc:
  - id computed from sorted targets with roles dropped (futon1b's default)
    → caught by the role-swap test and all 7 pinned golden ids;
  - registry accepting an in-place declaration edit → caught by
    `declaration-revision-is-immutable`;
  - hand edit inside a generated vocabulary region → caught by the drift
    test.
- Golden records: all four F1 fixture turns and claude-19's four Circus
  candidates (NgDb6h, x3SMUF, Ndo9tN, T-car3), each id pinned.
- Lean-mirroring tests are named after the theorems they mirror.
- Not re-run: the 84-test Arxana suite (warrant present, shas match).

Noted for Joe: the generator rewrites the key table in
`~/code/reply-proforma.md` between generated markers. That file is part of
every agent's instructions and is not under git; the 23 marks are unchanged,
only the table layout.
